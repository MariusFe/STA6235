Commercially produced ice cream is made from a mixture of ingredients: a minimum of 10% milk fat, 9—12% milk solids, 12—16% sweetener, 0.2—0.5% stabilizers and emulsifiers, and 55—64% water. Air is incorporated with the above ingredients during the mixing process. The finest ice creams have between 3% and 15% air.

A food scientist is investigating how varying the amounts of the above ingredients impacts the sensory rating of the final product. The scientist decides to use three levels of milk fat: 10%, 12%, and 15%; three amounts of air: 5%, 10%, 15%; and two levels of sweeteners: 12%, 16%.

## Visualization - Interaction

We now will construct a visualization. First, we must decide what goes where on the graph. Let's put milk fat on the *x* axis and create lines with air. Let's remind ourselves of the levels of air:

```{r}

```

We will use levels 5, 10, and 15 in our predictions. Note that if this were truly a continuous variable, we would want to look at the 25th percentile, the median, and the 75th percentile. 

```{r}

```

We also will color our observations on the graph by the level of sweetner. We first need to turn it back into a factor variable,

```{r}

```

Now we are ready to graph,

```{r}

```

We can see that as milk fat increases...

We can also examine this the other way, with air on the *x*-axis and milk fat defining the lines. Let's look at the levels of milk fat.

```{r}

```

We will use levels 10, 12, and 15 in our predictions. Like we noted for air, if this were truly a continuous variable, we would want to look at the 25th percentile, the median, and the 75th percentile.

```{r}

```

Now we are ready to graph,

```{r}

```

We can see that as air increases....
